    <h1>List of Some Birds</h1>
	
	<h4>Here is a list of some birds that I thought of</h4>
	
	<h2>DUCK</h2>

	<p>This duck is a fun bird for all to enjoy. It makes fun noises and looks cool in the water when it swims and eats things. I like the duck. Quacking noises etc. Fun mouth little bill. 
	
	<h2>SWAN</h2>
	<img src="swan.jpg" alt="a swan" width="700" height="500">
	<p>This swan is a big bird and pretty famous. Overrated bird in my opinion. Doesn't even make sounds and not fun. Not my favorite.
	
	<h2>CHICKEN</h2>
	<img src="chicken.jpg" alt="a chicken" width="700" height="500">
	<p>Chicken is a mediocre bird. Still better than the swan but can't fly or swim or anything fun like that. Nothing against the chicken but it just doesn't tug at my heartstrings like other birds do.</p>
